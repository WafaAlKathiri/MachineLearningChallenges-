In this challenge I explored the process of deploying a model and allowing a user to interact with it through a user interface. I also got to experience dealing with containerization tools such as docker. The Colab notebook showcases deploying the english to french translation model (which I worked on in the previous challeneg) using Gradio and the rest of the files are ones I used to deploy the same model using Flask and Docker it to offer it as a very simple translation web application.
